## Project Description

THe Belly Button Biodiversity Collection catalogs the microorganisms found in human navels.  The data can be found at https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.

The project features a dashboard that includes a bar chart displaying the top ten OTUs foound in a specific individual.  A bubble chart is used to displays the number of bacteria per sample based off of the OTU ID.

Finally the MetaData for the study is shown based off the id of the test subject, with all charts individualized based off their ID.
